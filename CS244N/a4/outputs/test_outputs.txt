You know what I do is I write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for the kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that got to be somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird <unk>
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He did it for <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, and California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting to AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> we never come to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please get that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you about this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and he was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I spoke to them was done in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water about almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break the barriers of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up to the end, and they hold up to the end, while others can't <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and alone, in large as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the contrary.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing his atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts in a iceberg that releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come back to photograph these <unk> as if it was about portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't be there going to exist in the way again.
It's not the death when it comes to us, it's not an end, but also a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually be able to see an <unk> iceberg here.
Here they are.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in the average size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, just at the same moment, every single child -- OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm goes into the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the sperm chromosome joins the X chromosome.
They both <unk> and it takes life.
We'll go back to them later.
In my activity that would be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is how people are going to look at the anatomy -- the anatomy of human bodies and <unk> how have the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role as performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> from patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've been working with <unk> people much lower than a half.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics is not fit in male and female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> involves many ways.
I'm going to put a few examples in the ways of having a sex that not <unk> in the male or female forms.
So for example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that we have in <unk> life.
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, <unk> body doesn't respond to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is evolving on a course typically <unk>
When you get the baby's going to look like a little girl.
It's a young girl. It's a little girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when you're growing up and developing the breast breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, like men, have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know her <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from an age of 19 years born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a boy and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and in the uterus, the areolar glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes to develop what's known as <unk> is that they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how well that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we get to a number of surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that it will be woman to be a woman who is <unk> <unk> <unk> to be black, he wants to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine what amazing thing is to have children are born like two people in one body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the fabric of their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called them to wonder: "What do you do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to reporters that there is no kind of test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't make a line of <unk> between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought that these were categories -- a stable categories that would be <unk> directly into <unk> categories -- they're much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go through the science of science, we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very controversial discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> of the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot would come up with a pen in front of the nose and if he was still not going to do it.
If I stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have any simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm arguing to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I'm nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I've got to admit that I'm a fervent snake of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much watching that music, <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
The Founding <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain to you why.
What they would do, was a <unk> concept, and we would associate it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as everybody remembers what our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming to the political power of the blood of the granddad being passed from granddad to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents would get rejected that idea and replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time and <unk> science.
And it is very clear, if we look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations for, and therefore <unk> the concept of being passed by a <unk> idea of birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened then?
And <unk> women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are going to go to the <unk> coincidence about the <unk> difference and again <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking wonder why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should do it with anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five, they were supposed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that you have a sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to these two things that are going to start at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, the June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born in particular, the March 1 of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because he was born later.
We find other people's rights.
So Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about it.
Mary, on its hand, doesn't have the same rights as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to spread.
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw online somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man -- no longer have to have a chromosome and to marry a woman who has to have a chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be involved in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships than people from 40 to 40 people I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this mainstream.
We've done a good job of defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is sensitive to being killed, unless you're willing to have a change of sex, in which case you have to live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had done a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twins to then pick them out, and then they <unk> their fame.
But when the phone was asked by the phone, he was a very <unk> operation, she said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered political seekers instead of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there might be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual activity.
And one of the things that has been interested to me are the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in Feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> as <unk> made me an <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk> of the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there are no women's <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more it has seemed like there are some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the brain and the male and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the Parents were very aware to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible to have got more <unk> <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of <unk> with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get to the future democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do is we do the ones in the others.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to <unk> how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than the building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd that you have never thought about new cities.
But they just ran out of building buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments in apartments are already <unk> and that the other half is still no longer not yet to do it.
You might try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid all the way and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new, new place to build a completely new, new, long apartments always and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction instead of putting them up.
So I suggested that governments will put up new reform areas to hold up cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less time at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of political speech.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 miles away from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections, <unk> <unk> had been imposed with a platform in which we were <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk to a TED talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, such as those rules that say that you can't go and run all the current residents of apartments.
It's a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes as much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the ground in a place like New York City, and in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with terrain terrain -- a <unk> that would give up there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, that it took to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is about 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince you that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is roughly 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 <unk>
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Wired leader came up to the platform and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained the <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might go to that might be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them and make the norms of <unk> so that everybody could be confident that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk>
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional situation to allow these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional approach was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the things in the society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting and <unk> one.
Immediately after the voting in the 21 to January 24, a <unk> <unk> <unk> is to two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new large center of the city that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years by getting <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow them to <unk> and to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and physiology of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to rise to the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insist on insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
So this is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love finding out, and more recently, I photograph and publish my blog and colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are holding the general people -- I usually go to a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
Being from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel I've won.
To go back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what you would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does someone have to do with that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm doing on.
I've brought seven pairs of interior, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after I was here to Palm <unk>
And since you don't know me like the woman who walks at TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the set for this week.
Doesn't it sound <unk>
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I have learned in this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger it.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the whole, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> impossible when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right person, not just you are <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the boy that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remind them to give them a little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside your inside and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there is no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a single personal style, it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just for what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this isn't going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there's always going to be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I am.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you put a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists, we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them into play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As an intuition that you might have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that I play with that parking bar I showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those small particles to describe these little particles.
But you don't needed to describe the large objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why he shouldn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to broaden it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good focus on the little <unk> of metal.
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you could a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip with a silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator itself, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up and get them out of doing these things, because I don't want to get them, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of the journey of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that goes on and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave at quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way that <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that's expanding and <unk>
And when I gave it a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every billion. of atoms who make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and so on.
It's just <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logical part of it.
So imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time, what would that look like?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they would do it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide and this one is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and growing museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better to show you the demo, and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken on from your launch.
So, let's go ahead and make it <unk>
Look around the museum that there are.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to enter one of my favorites, to <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click around, and we are now within the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the blueprint up, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside that they want to go to the end of the hall, right?
And still go forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixel <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get to do with 10,000 million pixel <unk>
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this is <unk>
I found out that the kids were actually playing something.
And I was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole Tuesday <unk>
And it seems to be very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into the depth and you'll see that you can actually get even to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit about perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you actually see what there are.
Here's where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really enhances it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another favorite brain.
There's a lot of things more here, but I don't have any time to <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple we walked in, and I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a zooming in it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel about looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things really doesn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even it doesn't come from the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I've got something to show you.
You think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the racing racing <unk> one in the last two decades.
So, some time ago, if you wanted to win a car career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is in engineering, it would have a real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting today is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming an open-air <unk>
And, as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note here, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the late summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like all of the existing atoms in a way, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a certain sense it's almost like in the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer -- and he threw it into Moses -- you still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> non <unk> and he said, <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something out.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, he played Italy and France, and at the end of <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> <unk>
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The timeline.
In the early late afternoon, there are people around here and there are making calls <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night, they all went to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everybody went to the center of the TV team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world would happen.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and consume.
Today we know all about the edge of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project in this project we developed small tags to track the trash in their change, in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle slightly more than a year ago to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that had not existed before.
They're going on complicated things and there is no <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that I <unk> doesn't still be somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we cut a day still is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we will be able to promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels and the pixels can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no windows, no windows, but when you zoom in, it opens up so you can actually happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody in the winter when they go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> so it happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact with a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let me happen, but a building that was still making cuts and holes in the water and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel in the air, it changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
And a flexible screen like this with a regular setup in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play a different kind of thing.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close, and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it did.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a entrance that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the <unk> star of New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as an input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can take all of the movement.
You can walk off the way.
And once we have the pixels in the pixels with them, we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our environment -- like a <unk> farm -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of you <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what it has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we have gone from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world of the power of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this might be that we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people engaged in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel as well.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel <unk>
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate <unk> more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about to live with good health?
Or maybe these people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to most of?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people will say creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of all, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing -- it makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: It's just about the past, or the future?
It's about other or about us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> by a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
So there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in the more bacteria that cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully effective environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm up dark. It's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort to their part.
It really is like a quick stream for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the output.
But for others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients to <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or destined to become something different, which is perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is kind of a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single and unique <unk> and human life, a little <unk>
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope that you have <unk>
When I was just going to graduate school, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- every single cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two dead cells.
But when <unk> organisms appear things to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year he was going on, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody was hitting his door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a magnificent breathing dancer.
He looks at it and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"That's <unk> says George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily differently.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to restore health in disease.
I wanted we living more and more healthy.
Evolution is to go through the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily serve longevity.
It doesn't necessarily follow the biggest or the stronger or the more quickly and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean in the bottom of the ocean -- that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in the empty <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the thinking that it would be that it would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we will become so much longer possible that it is no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution happen.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional traditional kind of traditional species, by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species, the distant planets are going to be able to be the isolation, and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a <unk> intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the choices that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes to the individual and familiar.
Think about that if you could also be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body making the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or to reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Would you not want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.

In the next year there was finished, in 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and in a week.
Not a lot of it is not a lot to be able to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of all.
These are those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of your bodies, but if they could change the cells from your <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing diseases is going to allow us to also have to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to do it with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> <unk> faster than allowed to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're going to present this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we would have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally would take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we are going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more boring and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants with.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already gone off the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
So the pilot would drive the plane with the Hudson River.
Generally, that's not the road.
Grab the engines.
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words that there is heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And the urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also gave up to my ego.
And I am sorry the time that you would focus on things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> at that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason why it's <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, dying is not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I got connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Around everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was given a miracle, not dying that day.
And I was given a gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You know, you're flying around with the challenge to imagine that the same happens in your airplane -- and therefore it's not that -- but you imagine, and how do you work?"
What are you going to say that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we get.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the biggest thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he got to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously the graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and her cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just do I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said to him, "A second is not <unk> I saw Stephen <unk> not that all of the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable to people."
I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they'll take your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how he was going to <unk>
I joined her brother and her father in that particular moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn it back into the art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- that have a technology that allows you to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs and then with the bad words, and then with the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things from one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could <unk> a machine like Stephen Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy who gets an email from him, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children, and I went to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we would do something totally stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken off the frames of the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we <unk> went to the shipping walk of <unk> my son was part, my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They're a couple of low-cost sun sunglasses that we bought in the shipping helicopter from <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So we took a camera -- we put it into the <unk> we put it into an infrared light, and now there's a device that is free -- and there's a device that is free -- we published the code -- we published the software to be low in a <unk> way.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says "No."
There is no hospital I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the other person and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of talking about a whole single night, Tony came back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photograph because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
I ran out of bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital parking lot.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he was like, "This was the first time draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone was finally coming to me and would take me back to her and would take me out of there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a top-down <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
<unk> <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of Los Angeles at the center of Los Angeles to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show what is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible -- do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible in a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had no programmer, I did nothing with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized something, and I was scared with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day do you every day when we are going to find out with something that we feel that you have to do. If it's not now, you're not me, and if I'm not me, who is me."
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very hard and at the same time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating only this fun -- fun at the beginning, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been interested in situations in the exact appearance of horrible with the only goal to treat. To look at social questions in ways that will be <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights on the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content that have no idea what it is and as content might be in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I would never have been able to <unk>
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been in some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be told me, nothing could be <unk> for something so dangerous or as dangerous as I entered the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to <unk> <unk> marketing and advertising, and that all the film will come together with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top up at the bottom of the beginning -- it has a brand, all the time; from the <unk> which comes before the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> on the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this whole idea.
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk>
He was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the brand X in the title.
Maybe you give a shoe, and you get the most cool shoe that you've got to.
The top car you've driven in "The largest movie ever <unk> the best drink that you've ever got <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the shot of the beginning to end.
And I'd love to be able to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny for the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you were very <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth <unk> to convince a couple of big marks in it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe maybe for the time we were going to go out of the movie -- let's look at it as a lot of <unk> idiots ...
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> the film or to be me?
JK: So two things.
MS: It means that you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a <unk> conversation.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And that's one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the <unk> is not the idea to tell the new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a mistake, and that mistake was this.
Actually, no such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for pictures of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that came up.
I like your <unk> <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: the free simulation of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the bigger problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk> like that strange bear that still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
He <unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want us to make a story <unk>
We want them to take a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there is him looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge giants and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies say that the reason they have so much successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, to <unk> on the pole, like it.
That's the big look general.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we have -- we're rather a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you all more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What's the common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothes.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> One single <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I wear accessories like sunglasses, or I like <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of the pets.
We have <unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand <unk> but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that we want, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case where you start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like things different.
I like weird stuff. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what is that?
What's the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important to me, what is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, it's not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scary. In which kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great doctor: Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was plenty of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality personality -- the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there is almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only become one of your strong dots or the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually make them <unk> and make you become some positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and marks, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to hold your brand identity, your personality personality -- what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute -- you are somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you rather a attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are kind of playful being playful as it will be playful like <unk> contemporary contemporary or audacious <unk> or audacious <unk> or <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
Are you conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're real, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You are a <unk> stable, familiar family -- safe, sacred.
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they didn't have control, they would have no control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI to identify the desire in the brain in the brain in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie line.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting on their way in schools with problems with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or the ones that I have had more successful is those in which I want to interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> they took their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies are not my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They did it succeed?
Well, since the movie was released at the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
He's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is giving them to their clients not to be a part.
I have always believed that if you get a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you pull out to the people that are pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees at the aversion to the risk of being preparing their whole company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can get.
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who by <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let's put it on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED last year.
The idea behind worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control systems.
If we are able to engage these systems that control speeds, and we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer using an engineer to set up this gray, so we're ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission <unk>
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you know is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part -- the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat that he didn't like our <unk> and he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense of me.
And then of experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that place: going on.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to make the goal soon.
So we pulled the seizure code, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit of a little bit big.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had the whole internal information.
I would take all of the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it was going back the operator.
So you know that.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and <unk> let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to match it with the real world with the real world <unk>
We need theories about recipients we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember, it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable, <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because the majority of the infections has been <unk>
They're not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called it and I went to an effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
So rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you deal with the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the actual goal of the attack was to do slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can't <unk>
I started investigating scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a few weeks of tough work.
We were going to be able to put them up dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> had to be one and same goal, but from different angles.
The tiny little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined that we have determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are going to be <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
That's the gray, gray, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values for example, with the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> <unk> which is still running during the attack, with fake data data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk> video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only about <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open tubes on a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator,
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about it. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or in an <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology of worms.
You make it more possible.
And if you made that, with what you can do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has made public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to get it up and give you <unk> skills or another one that makes users of wheelchair chairs and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, it gives you a great force -- that also increases its speed, and help you, for example, how to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things:
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's getting even more equipment to it.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injury in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the whole thing.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> -- Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton that I can <unk> I can <unk> 90 kilos for variables for a lot of hours.
Your flexible design allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back to the look at the users of chairs on the users of what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is coming from that it's climbing very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or another complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who does 19 years ago had an injury in the column <unk> and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got a few sensors to it.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals on board on board, here on the back.
There is some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down it was still <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost the whole feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor entered my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> you will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to have Amanda, and all the users of chairs to everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just come from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex for saying hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious stuff.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of rainforests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
While the chimps are dominated by the big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least dramatic apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario that has been sustained for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction is also putting in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of meat and deforestation is that you can't fill a stadium or a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter hidden -- the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that like the apes -- the love, the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play all of their life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game that you look at the game is that you see the roots by the same thing, the dance and the digital ritual and the ritual of a human ritual.
The game is the glue that unites us together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game and no football game.
Here we have a female and a young male man in the middle of a <unk>
Look what is doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual -- like <unk> and also how play requires and <unk> <unk> and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- a young female who's playing with water <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds, outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that bonobos are given us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with higher creativity and cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's go through the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be appropriate to play, they can be the <unk> times the most <unk>
So in primates, in primates, to allow for this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, <unk> and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, <unk> <unk> as a captain of a captain in an volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers are enjoying a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But yet there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge of and find out what our homework was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog owner of her house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who entered a call to save a live building just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go back to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall went to the firemen <unk> that at that height or less had just finished the fire and entered the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door to the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures for your home owner where, as you would expect, his trove was much more attention than my own.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> owner of the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she noticed on the other was that someone had achieved a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as voluntary firefighter I'm witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also from acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they are for -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be now.
They put food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we'll be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big big fan of the concrete.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that it's made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful <unk> buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small piece of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just to experts.
I personally didn't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they link together through magnets.
So you can't get in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire and the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue one in green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with one green makes light.
We can put a button in the environment, so we have a <unk>
If we can change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Rather than having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures using it.
To make it faster or more slow, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to become <unk> and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels -- everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why does the door of an elevator get open, or how an iPod does respond to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics have some electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we brought to the designers of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, that they don't have any expertise in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Get something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> barrel by motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk>
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I was very term time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that represents everything that is supposed to be asked to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members of the year and we put them working on the <unk>
Instead of the Third World to the Third World by the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a little <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes to me as if I took a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone is caught when you have caught the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help from this way to <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment that was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it made a good programmer, I developed an app.
Is it a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can do it.
I mean, it has a autism.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology is <unk>
And it spreads into viral form.
One responsible for <unk> city systems, to see this application realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are steals the batteries.
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just came out of <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that will use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that they had done by normal channels that would have led to at least two and three million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the California court of California that even the time is 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that will program in a couple of days, and it was spreading into viral shape is a kind of shot shot to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the government better than work, not like in private enterprises, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, no constraints, in the open and <unk> way.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to bring together together with efficacy.
And not only is it <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with the government.
Do you feel a big frustration before that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy, the government is essentially <unk> in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it's not just <unk>
Now, a lot of people have left government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
<unk> don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> The way it will think it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick people out of people to make them happen.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of the phone care of services and information.
It's the place that calls the phone calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered <unk> on the official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And finally, he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music good and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So, well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a conference center.
It has a web application, and it has a mobile phone, which is called <unk>
You don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> from Boston.
One day, this actually happened this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of waste.
How do I make it <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to you.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report saying, "I walked to the place, I found the cube garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
connected to two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper and cheaper thing to have the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, we would save the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people would say, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to pick up a new political leader and then we hope that the government will bring our values into our values and bring it into our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow layer of <unk>
It's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> which keeps that that we have been in which that we funded as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and as a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us with the government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to be dramatic to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of us face over who are going to be <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem, you don't care about making their voices heard.
They're using hands.
They bring hands to work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up, a <unk> by taking away from a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we are not just consumer consumer <unk> and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us together, will be a crowd, or we will be able to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here are impact around the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is important <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling they can have special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, she had power.
It was the last word for all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me, and I was approaching a good hospital.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and I was approaching him, and he said, <unk> still you feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to get it back and if I was saying yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that makes you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is, I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight to nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and they were running all of my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up through the room, and he took me through the room, and he said, "Come <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you about it.
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't tell him, I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget.
Then he said, "Just do I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is, you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I am."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> That's how you <unk>
Then, finally, he said, "All I want you to ask me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I was like, "Yes, <unk> so I am."
I grew up in the field, in the South Side -- I have a brother and a sister and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> caught us my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just come up with the <unk> of all the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take you."
My brother said, <unk> you know? And you always do the same thing as us.
And I took something, your sister also took a <unk>
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went to look at force and go, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I say it for power that it's identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that you don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My guys died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In the poor or black communities, they find so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In the urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or a parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some of the things that are well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you would care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence to be 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without a chance to come back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been telling us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die from the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> not to decide whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
At every nine people who have been identified has identified one that is innocent and released from the death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent one in B.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to ever fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
Actually, we don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
I were worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined its lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks, <unk> <unk> <unk> people to stop saying that in our history we cope with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went from obviously, with <unk> and decades of it -- racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage them with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "No way with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we would put us to <unk>
Let's think about this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, would support people, especially if they were in mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
That would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are absolutely fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
So lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that you will never get to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational that committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, the development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to your mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will for being in despair sites and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no related <unk> with technology and design, which allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to the basis of inequality to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women gathered just to talk to it.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get them to talk to me.
Do you want to come and get it?
I would say, "I do."
So she would say, "Well what are you going to do?
I read <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk> them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, please tell me what that idea of justice justice was about.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all of my best speech to the end of me and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> put up my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to deal with those issues, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> not to judge us by our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of a society, it doesn't look at the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with the powerful, powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, just like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers from 13 and 14 years old, which has been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what is not it?
The judge as an adult, but I see a child.
And one night, I was very late at <unk> <unk> if the judge can become something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a small, <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> to be treated as a privileged white <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a dividing line on how in this country there is no ethical thing, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> I had sent to court.
About two months, I had forgotten.
And finally, <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went back to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car walking around to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm an <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I approached it and I was hooked.
And I was standing in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected to my interior, with my identity with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the guy in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
You get the cops out there, the prosecutors the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All infuriated because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I turned to the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I just looked through the window and let them hear all that <unk>
I'm going to walk around here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> assistant was upset because the <unk> had gone in the room.
The assistant.
And he said, <unk> what you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up to me and looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> visit to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity should be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you to keep my view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your means of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to give you the funding that you spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be <unk> to make the law enforcement and <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say is that you would say this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not due to crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, per small crimes on property -- instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited about me today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be for the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second one day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survival, the first stop stop all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning <unk> the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So this is why of a <unk> stories -- to look at the negative.
That old saying, "If there's blood -- <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news to seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not about it.
Maybe what happens is we got a <unk>
Maybe the huge progress that was done in the last century by a series of forces are <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of species, water extinction and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at getting the problems and, in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita income per inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food to electricity, transportation and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy spent 25 to more than 80 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would do it.
And we keep <unk> and <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, mobile phones, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the last century, <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and, lately, exponential growth.
My good friend, Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law on this curve, Moore's Law in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in the war and peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the outcome of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, it is <unk> from Moore's Law -- there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
<unk> computation -- that my <unk> friends call infinite <unk> sensors and networks, the visual printing and its ability to democratize personalized production on the whole planet, the synthetic biology, the vaccines and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many people saw the victory in "Jeopardy" Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline they were doing.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to all of his beings."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy play.
He plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service, that can really affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every inhabitant in the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's short and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops were covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal as well.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We would take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
This is not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the U.S. electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have energy abundance we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990 after it happened to happen.
So you put a very famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of them is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's one hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, and gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any single <unk> saltwater, water, <unk> water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that it will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that goes well, and I have full confidence in which you can Coca-Cola do it in <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better communication communication in the midst of Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart cell phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, <unk> diagnostic technology now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes to it when the health applications are.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that you can bring these technologies into a mobile device with the board, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can be able to remove your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the payload of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> an RNA virus virus or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the health care and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to provide the world of education and the health and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What would you <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we'll have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D Academy and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we deliver three billion more members of mankind, healthy and <unk>
What about the voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard of, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion.
And if they are <unk> we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things <unk> things that only could do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> shape the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this teachers university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went on and began to <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we were going to get together to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
They probably believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special about it.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates the other concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned so much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There were about 20 degrees, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was gained more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters.
We put a genetic pressure.
There were no fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s and <unk> started in <unk> Europe started a lot of development projects.
The fishing development meant to impose to the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad, called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish on him, and we had studies in the South Sea Sea Sea Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we had we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny bit about <unk> remains that are fish on coral reefs.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The bottom happens to be a solid coral system in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
They didn't buy them. They were <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
It wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
I took the start of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you put this up something like this.
On the axis, we have to produce biodiversity, to biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end you keep <unk>
And that, in great measure, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous water.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time, there are just a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such and so I looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually they don't use the scientists scientists, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in patriarchal societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role in there that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas that we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that they can <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the Middle African people for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can actually fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why would they care?
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to giving, is Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made and what matters does that.
We all want to be <unk> " <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed something really, really difficult.
But today the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can have done that famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And from those, just a small percentage of these, is getting loads of <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things -- makers of clothing communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> on the rise of the popularity of the past summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called the Mountain <unk>
It had already published many of the videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> present with us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's on Friday, Friday. You want to start on Friday.   Everyone wants you to come up for a week -- the weekend.    KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
We saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group creators actually embrace a view and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big internal joke and then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, in the 20th century, this community participation.
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three hours version of three hours of time.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of it.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we all can be part of.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What do you do might have written that <unk>
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, just the very unexpected and unexpected can be able to make it out of the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> in New York City, I'm going to admit I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular by <unk> but often there is some obstacles that keep you easily circular through the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million people to see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth of all the new and creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of regime, creative communities of participation, the fully unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the fear of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't give them permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the current media today, but we will make the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so long friends, would now get it.
It was <unk> in silence.
She died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was so only 18 years old, when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls small.
For her, life had been meant to be a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat was replaced to sea dressed of ship vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the bed, rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
So if we were left first to take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil oil back to the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, and he died, and he was too much to get it, and the first apple that I tried to do, given by the <unk>
No apple had after the same taste, itself.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants from immigrants from immigrants from <unk>
Unlike the middle class in the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days twice a turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a master's degree in IT <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they didn't matter what it should be <unk> who was generally <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, we are.
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice would say, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were focusing on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened other business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classic student, relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was held in the other hand, and he was going to go with the violence, the abuse of drugs and the isolation.
But many of them received it through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I was elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't cooperate.
As a <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> it was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in places that I had never heard of name, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters on the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got into the boat.
He hadn't ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it, the more it was to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they <unk> living on the boundary of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a little bit of new <unk> new on the scene -- and not just it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was an energy there, an <unk> optimism mix of humility and <unk>
So I went on my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people for whom the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had been <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where <unk> was the social rule and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At the age of 17, it became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and bring the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
The way it can't do it proved to be wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel in Sydney when she died, <unk> miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night, a <unk> came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been easily easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could that wish for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
Can I give you a <unk> in your life, a brave <unk> in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see you safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is this today in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I was born, the great Greek warrior at Indian -- he was <unk> he would pull out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, she could get water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced with the magic.
And that was very <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give up this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technology, 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the clocks and the cameras keep the cameras to keep it out.
We love our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how we can use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers from the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
They put the text through the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And this --  he says, "This box belongs -- I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
At a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons to that magic of childhood childhood, those ideas that we were trying to <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to unlock fireflies.
And, actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me with a little girl was that a whole galaxy is going into a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I drag to this magical device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In any fantasy book, there's always been maps of maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain dots of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that the kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not yet outside the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and then we collect images from different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids are not doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are there many possibilities.
In the next book we asked you to have an interaction where you go on the iPad and the video on and through that <unk> you see a group of <unk> <unk> that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves with leaves ...
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology and is closer to another.
It will spread the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that I sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of all, or maybe not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail because we just heard of listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a car and a switch on it.
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information back to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs <unk> assistance.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale, and before I got up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need an <unk> lunch.
That is the best thing that it can happen, because it's used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week we will be available for the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to go from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, go back to reclaim control and to be captains of their own <unk> but also it can help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing shot of the costs of <unk> <unk> and other issues.
You can bring techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have the controls of navigation in <unk>
Maybe we even have in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food for fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one would be <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives in this moment.
What we did was we got <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, when it's open, you sometimes open in a <unk> space and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and at the next weeks we use your cell phone cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we wish to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at some universities, so that you will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be messaging services or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which shows up is still in their place.
Please take care of this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in photography came up with my first digital camera at the age of 15.
He mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because I used the camera that was in planning on the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way as photography.
You have to think a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real real?
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a slippery surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but of what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain, because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which you don't even understand the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But when you combine pictures is very important, it is very important, because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will keep to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken from the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom line is <unk>
But this picture is totally made by photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place you find it up, because you don't need to put the ideas out of the ideas that has on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew that I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was just captured in a rock.
And yes, even I made the house from the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to make a outcome of realistic I think it needs planning to make a result.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do good work when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
So if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the overall thing.
It's an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many others we usually see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here is an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something strange here.
And so I'm just going to talk about that.
Please turn into the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we use technological curves on small scales.
The answer is that if we draw it into a normal curve where you say, these are the years or some of the time -- and this would be any of the technology I would like to give you the diagram that would look ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you take an example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is as quickly as the <unk> in <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But don't go back to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development, that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't forever forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We put one of two things.
Or it's going to be converted into a typical curve -- like this until it comes up something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something will happen.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, what is that new way that you embrace the world?
What new state is leading the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at long-term things.
The time scale in which I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back about a half two and a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would take around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals were organized -- we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was floating about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical <unk>
Some of those droplets of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made they made materials from the outside and the droplets grew up grew up grew up grew up grew up grew out of grew a particular combination of them.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the more <unk> mobile forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> it <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we make.
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became <unk> being better at the time of bringing the chemicals together -- <unk> more, <unk> more chemicals and getting more.
Usually they lived in the time, were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> white dust that I try to hide the American security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and put it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
The writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big interesting step in which things became very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information and to communicate that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin, and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in that -- and we had a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community more and they were <unk> for evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities were close to that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that are supportive communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart cell, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
These began <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that these cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures that are responsible for us to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through periods of similar to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and processing data.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the <unk> tape, and so on.
And that aggregates us in something much bigger -- faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history I was telling you was taken a billion years from one.
The next few of the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
On the language -- the language -- so they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as the electronics, it seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose, is the right word to name something that leverages its own pace of change.
The more changes, the more you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process of <unk>
But I make it my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the scientific technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to deal with <unk>
I don't know that every transistor is in that thing of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers -- we think a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine that does that does something that you didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the summer scale.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please get a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions sequences at random, running all these programs, and take those of those who are getting sick to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to look at numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But once you could find two numbers in the order of the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we will get the best to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
So let's take two programs, that <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and the kids will get the properties of both these programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I would bring some mutations together.
And it tries again and it tries to bring together another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are tracking numbers in a absolutely perfect way.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to talk about how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once he went into a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he grabs a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're getting complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand all of the options that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers a lot faster and so we can run these programs very quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it comes.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I came up.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I would spend enough time enough to let me give up some of my fake fake of that.
Before I was dealing with the subject of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 to a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who's trying to <unk> the first base, you don't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone who is 10 <unk> hand up.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Women's League player in running more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're byproducts to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a distant place and a beloved <unk> has two clogged arteries and your family doctor comes it to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 of them.
But do you know anything?
She's actually getting very much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But they will ask them.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, good.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them into the world, and I fell on with the mandate of being perfect.
We would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a Polish student.
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Sachs was studied to a blood test.
Such likely.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the University of nurses at General <unk> in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the differential differential diagnosis and not standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if it was all of all, then it would know everything, or as possible, to close to everything, because I would tell you about the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lady <unk> to the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I tried the emergency room to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
and reporting the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what I sent to my heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart leaves and instead of pump blood forward, blood goes to lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did that and I started working on the treatment that he would expect.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And within an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful, and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, he didn't take attention to a voice in my inner side, that he would say, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
This is how the high school, and the ambulance next to the ambulance were taken home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would take the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where my car was my car to go home.
I went through the emergency service to home.
And there was another nurse, not that I heard from the lady <unk> before, but another one. I was told by three words, those three words that most emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember that?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of having come to their house, after I hit the high school, she had a collapse, and her family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency pressure with a lower blood pressure of <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
Just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff will <unk> all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was on intensive care, and I was hoping for every hope that it would be <unk>
And in the age of two or three days later it was clear that we never will.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together together.
And in eight or nine days, they would become what was happening.
And the ninth day, they left her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I was excited about it and experienced by the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, and <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
That's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is what I talk about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It tells us not that the things we did was wrong, but we're bad for us.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get out of the things and made sure that I didn't help me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day he was opened up the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if you put the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes -- I would go to those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned out.
Two years later, I was an office in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I received a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I noticed her throat, I was a little <unk>
He was able to penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he went to the door he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> shift my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he said three words: remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
I had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the upper ice, and that it can cause the close of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
You can get antibiotics up for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and came back to work, until again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, particularly working in a hospital, which is now going to have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought it had a <unk> calculation of it.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out to be normal. A colleague who was looking at the patient would have some sensitivity to the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I would give it liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it down and to notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon's surgeon.
They were both operated on and they recovered well.
But every case I was like, <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and how many colleagues say, is a <unk>
Most of them have been over the last five years.
They were embarrassed to be embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't afford and talk about my mistakes if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure.
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also knew that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, she would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that I know -- those who can't sleep, and the ones that I know; you have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes are going to be safe for us.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical malpractice and mistakes to learn what possible, from the first article I wrote for the first article I wrote for the first article that I wrote for the top article to my <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, in which one in 10 surviving drugs in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not right -- in a system where antiangiogenic infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 20,000 Canadian Canadian Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A self-organizing system is written every two or three years, and we didn't get stuck.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain on his chest, and it comes to <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms in the same way.
So all of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we eliminate all the professionals prone to error, well, it's not going to be anyone.
And with regard to that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art is already a custom -- I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the chief of surgery, <unk> -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to slow down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, they know it, and they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for all of them to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in a while.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human, giving mistakes mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people, and the average number of choices that he says to pick up an American American. It's about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in research followed for a week to a group of business companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> for these executives and the time that we would think about making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you are in the nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How is the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you make a question, if your answer is positive for you, please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day. They're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this in a very, very <unk> level at least that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park <unk>
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent water <unk> and this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved to go to that shop, but I was on one occasion, and I was like, why never do nothing?
This is the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in a <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit a manager and I asked him, "Do you have this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
lobby.
They had <unk> different classes.
They put a post to <unk> just at the entrance store.
We put it out there from six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped stopped when there was a 60 percent, that when there was only six or 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy an <unk> of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
From the ones that stood when she had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> us -- <unk> -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this didn't bother us.
Now the theme of the day, financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement about about one million Americans, from between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money offers in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> to people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to raise different options.
We found that the greater the number of funds funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme boom, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the death rate went to the <unk> <unk>
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there is more choice, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choice, the more people are being used to avoid actions or investment funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to the more and more possibilities.
The most likely that we do is that we make the decision, even when this is against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in health.
They're more likely to pick up things less <unk> even though you saw them better.
The main reason is that we can look at that massive variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
So today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard that before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today, which is less than today.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of getting rid of the strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales -- <unk> costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> saw 10 percent per <unk>
When the Golden <unk> corporation just eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> are gained <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know, you know that today's living supermarket offers 45,000 products.
In a Walmart shop are offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have come up about how to handle the choices is the pioneer of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a life of life.
Those who are really willing to choose, are you given 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't be able to do their <unk>
This evening, before we started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience to a holiday on vacation with all paid it to the highest highway in the world.
Here, a <unk>
read.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really would hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought that they thought it was more real.
Because the images made it to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of the overload of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences among options, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very very highly <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit card or credit card than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for the people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> over <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were getting into a <unk> plan.
That meeting was exactly how we had a little <unk>
So what we added was that we would ask the staff to think of the positive things that you would think in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent, and an increase in the amount they were interested in to save or in what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a aisle of magazines.
What we saw is that the supermarket <unk> throughout <unk> <unk> the magazine show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because the rating indicates how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
This framework is totally useless.
The categories should tell you something that you will say something to you, not that the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
I'm supposed to know who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just put it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision buy a car.
This is a German driver of cars that allows us to <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the shots.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options, 56 colors, at a few four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go out of a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much you are.
If you look at the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones are coming from many choices to ages, <unk> the default button and again and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
So even though the choice is not saying nothing about the preferences of decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle <unk> we can handle a lot more <unk>
All these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more you try to be in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the East East Germany, if you had a typewriter that you had to write to the government.
And I had to register a text of a shot text from the machine.
And that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message that could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this is going to be freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page, that page is going to end up with a little yellow dots printed on every page that is still a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And no one seems to do it a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of thousands of old people online, and <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by illegal media to steal money from our accounts when we bought it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it in a <unk> computer.
The secret service service -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this gentleman -- Sam <unk> and this has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today it's more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not really driven by money.
There is another thing that the movements, they motivate them the protests, motivate them to understand laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a set of role on the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, officials like Anonymous who do it to protesting and the last group are the national the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority in the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the break last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
Last week, I asked one of the Dutch government meeting to the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you have <unk>
Well, you need to do it if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would give a foreign authority of foreign authority.
And they were using <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found lots of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications tools in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So the Western governments can provide tools for <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it gets further.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, well, it looks like a bad thing, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's at play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
While we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we will live today, will be forever.
Are we limited to any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that should be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no burden in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead because it was the only birth that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it so much.
So I grew up with lions.
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and livestock and also are mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, about six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of their father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because I even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so that they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart --  came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So they jumped in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which you turn off and turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It would take everything.
As you can see, the solar cell charges -- the battery load the electricity up to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are going to go and join the lions so that you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
They are <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've built it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used for Kenya, <unk> to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and also being used to <unk> elephants in their farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and she said that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now like my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions -- you're working on the electric geography.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of electrical -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: So I read it once, maybe, and I have tried it before, but I have tried it before, but I was trying to get a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it up in every single step that I would take away from mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would go all the time by studying Kim <unk> history, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except for the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought that would happen all my life in North Korea, until everything changed a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague, sister.
That said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will be lost in this world, because we haven't eaten it in the last couple weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
At a long time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was left in the street, holding a child holding his child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one would kill them because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine, <unk> North Korea to <unk>
At the end of a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark to dark at night, except for the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the river <unk> which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, it would see bodies floating on the river, at times.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with Pakistani relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like the refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not only difficult but dangerous, because the refugee Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made -- when I was arrested for Chinese police, and I was stuck in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> one officer told the other, this was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though it had been <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and finding work, all the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to bring it to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've got to be very different from 67 years of <unk>
And I even went through a identity crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I would call with a lot of pride and proud of mine.
Although I went to the living in South Korea not easy, I made a plan. I began to study college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family to my family, and as blame my family was going to be moved to the force to a location from remote <unk>
They had to get away from immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 miles through China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked you all of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border of <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border of <unk>
After I pay <unk> and bribes, was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in jail at the short distance from the <unk>
I was going to go between the immigration office, and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to <unk>
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I would hold it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why is I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village to <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the people in the face of the people in the face of <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting its freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of language, practical practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in touch with the family, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of help and inspired in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you'll see more and more North Koreans around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is Center, <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast food <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of Southern <unk> so it stands for something else, so they changed to the South Angeles as if this is <unk> which is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --   <unk> of <unk> food, fast food.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a green desert, Los Angeles Center, home of food places to carry and eat in the car.
And the curious thing is that food places to carry kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think that will happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time they go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs in <unk> and sold like <unk> cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a forest forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
That's 45 feet x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group of paid long made out of the gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got on top of it, and on a summary they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on in it?
A court for planting food in a piece of land than no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I am."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had a story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> safely.
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting billions of tomato plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> would give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, grows your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. I took my kids there.
I will become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would be able to see what Earth can do if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You would be able to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that can be done, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, good, man, I felt bad guys were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes be going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to take his <unk>
There was another occasion to put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this was affected and how it used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all of them voluntary plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some <unk> eat <unk>  But if none of this is wrong, if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see these guys that are on this way that are on this way that they are on this way for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to carry <unk> and turn them into a healthy <unk>
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people out of the street, to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take them, take your <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road street.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not forever, it's not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we would have.
And especially if they go <unk> and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we built roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, would we want a <unk> road <unk>
The solution for that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is that we use a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can pass through it, so all the water water flows into the sides and you will have a road road to drive, and you don't get it to water anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this highway the stones on the surface of the surface.
First one stone, then a little bit more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, don't do that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage is in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little amount of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will become <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So, if you drive through the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel from that to clean <unk> and we can cut out the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of hybrid wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is make the steel, melt the steel, melt up by these <unk> and the stones will get back to the surface.
So today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine to <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tested many samples there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a <unk> lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
So we made the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and we put them up with our <unk> machine and the control machine, and we went back to a try.
We can do this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers using the power of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even they can actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the <unk> sound in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she screamed at my father.
I didn't know what it would be, but I could see my father was really, really happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school."
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban took away from Afghanistan and made girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one would be suspect where you would go into.
We had to hide the books on their market bags to look like they were shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us got a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we would take our life out, the teacher, students and our parents.
At a while, the school was suddenly closed for a week because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother was to school, and that's why his father <unk> it.
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It took away two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember that there was moments that I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can give it to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the middle -- and if my family had not been as committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud of graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was relocated from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, which I carry on to the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global gift of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, even though they were still in front of an <unk> opposition.
As <unk> is not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get home, they are the phone, a voice would pick up that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would try.
<unk> already, if he <unk> he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter by his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and that it sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school they tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We would argue that these changes didn't last much, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, I see the future <unk> and a comprehensive shift.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never become a revolutionary <unk>
It has been almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens that are embedded in and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men who were <unk> were in the edge of the regime, the fall of the regime, are carrying out of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the West, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and a few loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
We went out of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a top-down and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national exploitation.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a single <unk> and I started organizing workshops on the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we started the Women of Women -- <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders.
I found it with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> and more <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, gradually the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we were found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American virus, and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of official officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their ski rapes in the prisoners and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset, becoming more, and it's gone away from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, the social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to stand up with our history of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as nation, chose bad, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what we needed the choices, which only is the polarization of the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female the more that you will need to have the representation of <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as an outrage, and I'll call them anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also putting the mercy instead of <unk> and collaboration instead of competition -- inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that the Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately needs to be in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions of the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> which spans all of the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers the <unk> it grows into the <unk> that grows in the divine matrix of compassion that makes it all existence.
So you say, "My <unk> does all all things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They all get rid of the taste of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a cynical question that has an equally noble response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the fact that everybody makes a long run, why she's left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who would kill him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no education in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and editor at the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I believed my alma mater, would hold me into the head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets <unk>
The man, who I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trick, of love, where every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English University, and I have an MBA in <unk> from <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them in Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Center.
I've been nearly 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and she's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can move to anyone, all races, all of all, all of all, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and so long duration of another way, in the families, the last place that we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who did, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence -- than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, they were killed and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or your patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting at my side of New York City and started to <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and working in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field guy.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and an <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, which was so so that he had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion in helping girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in every relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do any for your partner, and so I thought I left my job and <unk> and I went back to the end of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a <unk> and financial trap carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those things come in.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to be so safe he bought three <unk>
One had the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third time in his pocket.
And he said he needed these guns to cause the trauma to live smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never brought my hand, my life was already on danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy for always, because I loved him, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had been very <unk> for the wedding.
It had been a isolated accident, and it never would make me damage.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in the head that would take several times to the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our chest moon would spread through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk> on the face.
<unk> followed by one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or employment at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Let's go back to my question: Why is it <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help me to tackle the <unk>
The other question everybody else does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people, because we give us the victims, we know something that normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last stage in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gotten to marry, whether of financial resources, and then manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who owns her mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's not just going?
I was able to go down, because of one last <unk> up up to her to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family and family and family <unk> and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to identify victims as victims as <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people to be a way to say "The guilt is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims are intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who are also <unk> that they learned that they learned their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a <unk> survivor of domestic violence.
I became marrying a man and kind of cute and you have those three children.
I have that <unk> black <unk>
What I'm not going to have more, ever is a <unk> gun pointing my head into my hands of someone who says I will.
At this point, just like you're thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> which was <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were from small or they're <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting their daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up to my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and that's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard about here.
Aid just thrives in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence just threw light on it.
We are victims we need the whole world.
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the abuse of the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their fellow jobs, their friends and family.
<unk> their view of the survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims that is safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't be dressed like this.  So fortunately, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothing on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to take them now, but to find out it later on Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these chairs are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through your head, because it is when they're going to laugh about me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought of myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and photographer told me that I would take my back and get my hair out of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there is a very little bit that we can do to transform our way, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being an sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, one <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape of <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage of my heritage that I have known to be able to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now shows up <unk> and maybe there are some people who are <unk> they are <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's surprising.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list -- still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you put your studies, and you have a copy of the studies, and you have a stick and some work on your back, whether you want to be president of the United States, but you have to get your credit <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always ask me is whether all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was going to do, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and never use, except the previous couple of them, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent of being able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenage girls who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only young black and Latino young men in New York City, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
So when I looked at this talk, I learned that about 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes into 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the smartest hair, you will feel very happy and so beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I would like that.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever have some of you ever ask: With some simpler legs and the smartest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> <unk> but probably be the deepest women in the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that will keep in this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion for me to get to the camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I was not me who <unk> them.
There was no <unk> <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit of serious <unk>
In fact, most of them were given tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday on his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and the five.
He had the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to New York City on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
Here's when we started to ask the tourists who were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our daughter changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes, and how it can and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion is the whole year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped in the tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the top grocery store that <unk> small views on <unk>
And he described what had felt at the age of five standing in that same place.
<unk> that reminded of its heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I'm always getting the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the photo, and I didn't want to come up with someone and ask them, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> group.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as characters who were silly <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press on the press and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> they are important, first of all, they provide chemical ecological food ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural waste.
<unk> people all over the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria and they will absorb the anthrax that they would stretch and cause big losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture, <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and the Lower Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, it's about very important <unk> in the open culture, in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years later, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug that has been treated with a drug <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India, and they've taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb to <unk> The number of cases has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Africa, we have an awful trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a construction problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed opinion because he saw it <unk> without spending energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not really not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Kenya of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
The 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, all you would call it to it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians -- we decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got to <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia into this absolute valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local local growing tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people weren't at all who were interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go back to work, and we were quite amazed that the local people in so <unk> valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible to do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."   <unk> to save the people from Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato It would grow up in Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and red, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you call it, "You're never going to go.
And I thought only the Italians gave mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the Americans did, what they were doing, and after what the ones were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that we would join the <unk> people of Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are a <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture, like my children, would be my children, I want a long way."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture, like my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "I'm small <unk> written by <unk> who said about the whole economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and he said, you know, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to only answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We put together in a cafe. We got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you going to do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, helping them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they give them, but not in their community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunities have they <unk>
So, planning has this serious point of planning.
The smartest people in your community, you don't even know the ones, because they don't even go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face and you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family doctor, who sets up with you at your house at the kitchen table, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform her passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending garbage where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really difficult.
I love you.  So the government says, <unk> <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company.
The planning is the kiss of death of the business spirit.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to a conversation with you.
You have to be able to do it -- and it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk to you about this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first <unk> industrial revolution -- fossils and <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a great story that was in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year we had met this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed -- <unk> generic companies, <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you all the absolute devoted <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and to look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of them were just started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> those who come from a small business of small businesses in bars along with their dedicated devoted environment who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what someone has done for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what would we need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't shift a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask for more of the things that I don't call the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for stores to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and make them happen.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant giant giants who give <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> since centuries and trust a city.
It's always going to fit the music.  There is a game in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a very nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the lived and lived time.
He gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my daily life.
It seems to me, it's easy to be able to be able to catch up the day and to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the old help and new friends transformed the wall of this house left on a giant slate and he painted on her phrases to <unk> Before they died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before you die I want to be judged by <unk>  Before you die I want to sit down on the line of <unk>
Before you die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before you die I want to plant a <unk>
Before you die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before you die I want to <unk> once more."
Before you die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before you die I want to be completely myself."
That abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me <unk> in tough times.
It's about knowing that you are not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving rise to the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center -- we did a kit and now have been made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions on the increase, it's more important than ever, to be able to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we were going to prepare for death is one of those things that would give us more power.
And you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hope and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, high and very <unk>
It's not talking about, but it's transmitting joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this: Never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I didn't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown thing.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
They would get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and he would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look cool?
But most people don't agree.
And, in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of a society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though I didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, in learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual individual it manifests <unk> from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that are faster in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, watching the washing machine and eating anything that would be <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, and innocent nature, a child that would see the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there has been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change for normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on your interior and honestly, the search for normality, is the ultimate potential of potential.
The opportunity for greatness progress and change dies at the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, giving me a kind of communication to students students.
I was scared.  <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown books.
But when those conversations, I felt what it would have had to have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
Just so I sat down when I had these conversations with my students, they surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenge, from energy to environment and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations may not happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that you can see your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
So what science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us how to study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to understand it.
And when you're describing your science, careful <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them dumb things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, which is all as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can actually communicate your science without engaging ideas.
One of the things to consider is to use examples, and analogies and analogies. They're ways of clothing and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do the <unk> kill them, kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported as much in the language of the language of our brain and we're going to spread.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it actually inspired the only design of the Eiffel <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give it a graphic that will drive our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they would expect.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English tree is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for a public charge no matter what they have to do, and when he <unk> it gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament was allowed to quote newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put him in the London Tower and he was dressed in the London <unk> and he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think that it's true.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, the leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented with all sorts of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the People in the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it a <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired and <unk> because this debate would be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the failure and the <unk> was that the House of America was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives did not want to be Washington -- of power.
They didn't want to call it King for whether he would give him or to her designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> little <unk> little <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And it didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "Oh, ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take him seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't cooperate.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> <unk>
President Barack Obama got enough to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is a <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you about this is that the American title of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear <unk> the world's largest economy and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has unique.
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be humble when you tell them they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words much more than the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to foot under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is heavy and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and <unk> with the front.
Like others, I carry a cheap button of light, and she holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on Earth.
I got away my hand and all of a sudden I remember a mining that I met days earlier, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole, and their lives without paying no reward, and often dying.
I went home from that hole, and I went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents and in 2009, and I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was the world, but not to be as grade.
When we ended up talking about it -- I was very pleased to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me kind of <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey began to modern-day slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculus says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced over the whole slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about a <unk> of <unk>
However, today you can enjoy entire families for generations for generations for <unk> debts from 18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promise of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, low violence threat and cannot escape.
The slavery is operating on the <unk> the critical goods by slaves are <unk> but those who are the ones who make them are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost every world, and yet it's illegal for all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met a brick <unk>
This strange and formidable show was like entering ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families would spread into a heavy <unk> cloak in their heads, to 18 at 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> I was doing that pee out pretty much.
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my very quickly side, grabbed me and said to me, <unk> don't just do it here."
And he explained to me, very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
You couldn't afford any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and she complained that he <unk> it.
<unk> I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying <unk> stones for miles per <unk> to get the trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who had the charge and the kids would put them into their heads with straps -- <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers destroyed their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> their houses.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness that it was told to be hard for me to work with safety in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously previously <unk>
It took me up to a few stairs <unk> who would have this <unk> <unk> faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known for craft, they are local.
They have small rooms -- small, private rooms -- where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to <unk> and they are forced to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer from sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> fear and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> of the stairs where you <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interact with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families being broken into the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
Black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest <unk> lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two brothers, some younger kids, a few younger kids, makes sense.
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, even though we don't know swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, it's thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the youngest slaves under her command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working on the last networks.
On the cold night and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> is possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
I went through a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike.
He asked us to put it on a road road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come up quickly.
And then pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we put on the path and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures on my head as I went to <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the way ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes in front of a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their back, and as they were looking for gold, they would take on <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they went out of the face they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet away, and these people are carrying heavy stone bags, which then they will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to close to the side, we see them work at the same time and also to be children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By the death of their uncle, they took off the debt of the uncle to be able to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I'd worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors said to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he had to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a remote possibility to a remote possibility -- which inspired me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not quite <unk> These are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images come up with a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire, that that fire shows about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> are like management studies.
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So today we will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of more human activities.
We got the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably a certain level of skill and probably a certain thing that can have a genetic component,
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, like it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a <unk> <unk>
In the last few years it's been made very much in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and an objective measure.
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement that have no biological markers -- so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to clinic. What if patients could take their test them together?
You wouldn't need any personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in clinical clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a way not conventional to a try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the elastic ropes.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds to the talk, and we can imagine as a dancers of a toy ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce the sounds and we all have the genes needed. The <unk> for example.
And as they did, they need an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal cords as it comes in, and as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom line you can see a bottom-up example of <unk> strings of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more peaceful and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- so they are both not <unk>
The neurologic test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They're both <unk> OK, but they also test tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens is happening.
When something happens to be so <unk> it appears on a mass scale.
These are some amazing goals that we get ready to address.
We can reduce the patient's assignments for patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
We could often get goals.
We could make a massive low-cost for the clinical trial for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So in order today to give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
<unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or no disease, I can call under a price and to stop recordings of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six hours of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, like, 10,000 people, will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data attached into different circumstances and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the confusion of confusion in pursuit of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> accuracy on this point?
So much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network as well, what we would take on the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March after March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
Are we <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in the whole, with no windows and, usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more efficiently -- the perfect skin -- even more <unk> we do the impossible -- and we will get in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with a lot of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11th of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that would be in Japan.
So shortly time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> -- there was the place working as a part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first peoples affected by the wave.
The measured water level has reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers ground inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
It would take off the waterways and the <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons of tons of fish and tons of fish dead, <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, they were both volunteers like the neighbors and found that similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from villages around us to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that these pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were trying to wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> in the village.
It helped clean the toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be a place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
I had the honor of them and I had the honor of that day to be able to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we went through my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and to repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night, I got on Facebook contacted some of them, and in the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and they knew that we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came out of the more pictures and they got more <unk> so that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks, he had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village in the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner into the time development libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we were in <unk> is a different story, it depended on of course the <unk> of the photos.
I could get an hour. She could be <unk>
I could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail that water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures taken in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae -- even oil, all of this together with the step of time -- still <unk> so that <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless I was clean, dry and <unk>
We were lucky at hand.
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
I had begun to <unk> her, but he stopped realizing that I would get them even further.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and get the whole picture.
When he collected their photos to share some of their history with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photos in a fire station on the rubble pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go into the water while the <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find her family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his pictures his son was 14.
For her, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift that he could tell you, something that he could look at, something that he could remember about the past that would not have been marked by that summer day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean away from <unk> pictures -- the great <unk> -- most of the most <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us in, but the first thing that we would do to look for.
This was about the project of restore small bits of humanity, from giving back to someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to some of them connected with something bigger -- and using their talent for something that are not really a perfect models of perfect skin.
To finish the end of this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't even stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular photograph of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering about a baby, <unk> to me because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs -- right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curious with this picture of a bullet who cuts through an apple on a sample of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to one million or a billion dollars, but to a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create a slow camera video that can create a slow motion in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without the <unk> <unk> and you really challenge the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and put it in a second -- second or <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a bunch of photons from just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the view of the light in <unk>
Now, all this --   remember, that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons which starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes on to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there is a bubble of air that bounce inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights from the top of the bottle, after several boxes, which you think is <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week?
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow slow movement.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition here.
But if you look at once you look at this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light comes out of <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the sharp light inside its inside and it becomes after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at UCSF
As photographers, you know, if you take a photograph at low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we'll go to a billion times faster than the <unk> exhibition, so you can just go into some light.
We send that <unk> that <unk> of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of that data in raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see it after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, and from there.
Where we could get those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way down to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what it is that it is that it is a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a blank picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our pocket.
We have things for exploring before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood -- this is pretty hard, so that actually this is a request to scientists so that start thinking about <unk> as a new sketch of visualization to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself was a scientist, converted science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> data <unk> are not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computational photograph with slow and color codes.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on.
<unk> should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes comes <unk>
<unk> the corresponding corresponding of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime of the humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone. You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a smartphone. You can record a song, and you can put it up and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they would be looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who now have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> One Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's very much all today got a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> of the E.U. was presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European mobile company, every monopoly on the Internet from all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who texting a <unk>
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet <unk>
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this database.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone phone providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people that went out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some people even said this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me to <unk> all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll not give you this information.
At the end, he <unk> a agreement.
They demand the demand and they send me the information that I would do.
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> ruled the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can come up and go, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit scary.
But it's not just me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them some of them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big network of communications network.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what time they call each other to each other, what time you fall in.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with who, who sends an email who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And <unk> would have known who I was in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who were leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, not each of the <unk> <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to pay them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just the same fashion.
When you go home, you get your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi short, what's going on?
Not enough.
Hi short, what's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> so it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one I came at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them from today.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
Come for you.
<unk> Christmas are in the mall, they drive in circles in search of parking lot, and what do you see?
16 places to disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the C P. is just one of them.
There was a gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim <unk> and live in New Jersey.
If they don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial thing.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I would <unk>
If my three sisters older people were going to public school, my parents would attend to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside -- and if we didn't take all of the note -- all the <unk> all over my mother's <unk>
My father taught me how to walk five years in my feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that you can <unk> it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot to me.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they keep being all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as Higgs motto campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> to die of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three whole months without eating them, so we would take away from dawn on the sunset is really easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to dance school."
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer summer summer on the coast of continuing I was not coming.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
On summer summer often my father was drinking milk on his back, so I was drinking milk on his back, I was drinking in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of the state of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet department.
I all <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow into Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "While the end will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of <unk>
Thank God <unk> in the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  So they gave <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying there, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why, and she said it could not make the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that she was literally born and gave it to a actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> <unk> actors without disability to disabled paper.
At night, I went back home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> directors don't <unk> actors -- not white, with disabilities.
Just <unk> people perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made me <unk>
And in my first tour, he took a famous Russian book from New Jersey to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to the high speed of the New Jersey road with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without the veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I do know that you never heard that little adventure that says women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind them to remind directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire, and he has a <unk> Keith <unk>
I walked as if it was to a graduate school, I went to a study and sat me into a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held up to the speaker desk to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not come back with me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was like a <unk> and pasted my chair.
Something that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
They are said that kids are <unk> but they never got away from me and no more than a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would say, clips online <unk> like, "Why would you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite one, <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We really should pray for her.
A little bit suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I've grown up with the media, but I don't think we would be born.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive pictures, it <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> trip has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> through the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> a charity to give kids Syrian refugee children, a tiniest bit of what my parents were passionate about.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a small town, a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
Nothing for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no jobs in the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
One day he got a gentleman who offered him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I presented it to a young.
Finally, you home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy of that small village with dreams of the big city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So how the story of a small child in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that we call it "the <unk> of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity, of the city -- for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we were not allowed to provide opportunity, the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of cities Vietnam.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They do not quite anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I had seen me forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house the youth leaders at a corporate summit critic.
They went to about 90 youth leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the large challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> he saw an opportunity and <unk>
She started a company of <unk>
They started riding motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new chance.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the pinnacle of corporate initiative and how innovative and how to create a culture of corporate entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent from plastic from the overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So Mohamed saw a chance.
She started a company of <unk> design and <unk>
And he created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started delivery of flowers for wedding wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink profiles.
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and creating a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to <unk> in the development and put it out of their businesses.
It will lead to the young people with the resources that they need to do is support the support they need to move from understanding to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park park, this is how it is called, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help you rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to be young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in upstate New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something terrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> <unk> balls and <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> they were too lazy to get out of what they had <unk> who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it would be <unk>
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you sell the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> cleans our garbage, the reason for 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his routes and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go further into it.
So I started working as a garbage <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And he operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong one of them quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of trash every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of the United Nations Office -- the waste collection is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> and I learned the reason.
You're going out and getting into your traffic all day and they pass off around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
She never stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
They're always going to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste is the most important work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to crawl from its <unk> and their dangers inherent in us in very real ways.
We have been controlled for decades and centuries and <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the economy engines start to fail when it's endangered <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
This is just about the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually don't have to hurt us and save them and take it out of our coffee cup -- our bag of coffee, our water bottle.
We use them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side which is to take on it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste collection that might be able to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us away from ourselves, from ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, I heard my son little little <unk> and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> paper like he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that I started to research collection collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together many times and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species should include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The <unk> waste is what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the quantity of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, you will get a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life making a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects today as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall from various floors, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Addis Ababa, me.
This is the kind of building that we showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after looking at some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects, for <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like with Africa has nothing to do with Ethiopia.
It's a pity for a place rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was actually enchanted by the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also among two parallel roads that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets -- <unk> all the entries from the building.
And this goes into a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that goes through its own way, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, changing every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be attached to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from dresses on the <unk>
They have the fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This would be <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what he <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the shopping center because in order to program there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was far more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity will be almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling like a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is actually collected water to the <unk>
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a project that is so big, the bigger that I have designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I got special attention to <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks of the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of <unk> <unk> with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make a framework that ensures that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can upload it and <unk> and make activities like running a <unk> <unk> in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improving the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair very bright hair and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up on that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in time after I was out of school was a little later and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took on the table of my teacher from grades.
And then, I did.
I took the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all out of <unk> and I put myself a row out of a row -- just to be there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got paid.
It was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk> me.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason that I thought that this little girl was so good for <unk>
I remember jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, primates.
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses for spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels is like the lab where you study the <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
I took the lists of high school reading from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> no <unk>
Without it, there's no <unk> I know that it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as much as it does it, almost they have all of them.
This year only has been 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the pursuit of time -- the most <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> I am, all you might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details that are going on, right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, to their <unk> are a very famous narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel treated we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
So to be <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details are going to <unk> to <unk> the knife right?
They <unk> us all of the amateur novelists and that is something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she makes to give me pleasure from another, maybe right now."
And you start to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm of cool that <unk> detects in their lover, it adds up to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get away from the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like big hair <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> came out of the photos.
That's why I heard that Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links right language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of spades, suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are looking for knowledge, looking at the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, that to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffer, it causes to cause us to create a lot of more profound feelings than a wise man who can help us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for female women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we would give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion is that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was being used to be used to the idea that his woman would do.
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man, not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that made his wife, without realizing behaviors <unk>
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> really described very well how the <unk> do you look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more we are, the more we became the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since I was sent messages to himself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What's huge though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of dress, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting to do what you have to get your self and get it out of what ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- it takes your <unk> cow <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> shows you the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinking about the curse of the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but tell you.
<unk> it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and he says, "Not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like <unk> as a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute on the same way.
All of a sudden, <unk> can be <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
Just <unk> fiction just jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> them at the table.
And look at what he <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying scary -- he took <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo <unk> <unk> and landed on the Beaufort Sea <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but her presence on the surface of the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective process of a <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the largest peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the Apollo crew crew one.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which ran after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that was 24 plus later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask why the <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why is the most <unk> mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why plays Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West over the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's testing.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> was <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a sailing ship, but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew at 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the Apollo crew 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer, or feed the world's population seem to have been <unk>
I remember watching the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that not to <unk> the escape tube <unk> from the rocket.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So it occurred to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear that all the time.
We've heard this over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists would have found us and have enriched uranium with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale of <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an alternative explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that you have been created by less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years where they were involved, Microsoft, Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are <unk> in particular the incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to offer people.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to be driven by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is that they have a huge capital that has never invested in the development of intended technologies to solve big problems because they don't have any immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve large problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want energy sources of alternative energy that can compete at price at the price.
Now, technologists, of the entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties are <unk> the development of an enhanced energy <unk> increase a significant increase in research and development and some kind of risk control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an HIV policy from America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know that famines are a result of failure in the food table.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the food distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and cycle of food, but there will be famines for bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president declared the war in 1971, we do, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some brutally resilient kinds of cancer, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
Big problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can do it and we need -- but these four elements are going to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem: institutions must be able to support <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
<unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is with those criteria.
But it's a model that is in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is not a politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous mythology -- and there is no popular mythology of science as the idea of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the future solutions will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to give you the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a very large decline of trust, is a very general <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I kind of bow to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have it.
But I can go to survey surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no many evidence of it.
That is, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But this is about enough evidence.
What surveys of opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What they look at is the attitudes that people are engaged when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
They probably would say, to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very promising answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some of you but in some of you not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make trust <unk>
We don't expect the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a kind of a <unk> officer or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying that I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading, but from any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about confidence.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to make good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I would do.
I want to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
It would be deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you think about it, he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that you would take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we are trying to do before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to do?
And, of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will find that the accountability system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must have all of you all know similar examples.
It would take all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more heartbreaking and that things would be different if we are worthy of being worthy of trust and give them to people who are reliable and if we want to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple acts -- what it doesn't make it right.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task is to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the difference enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you cannot <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to bring them together that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That does every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> without giving us better.
I carry them up and get the money back to the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is that we trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, at the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is to break its physical body to the pixel <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool -- the barriers.
But the two hands still stay on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity skills.
In the Science division of Microsoft, with Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area.
They would take a slightly transparent bombsight on the way to detect your fingers and the face, now you can lift your hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us will have bought and returned things around the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how can we make them physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my graduate Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel at the lab.
This magnet, <unk> it acts like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation <unk>
And to program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be able to <unk> and become reproduce and go back in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, unlike monitors or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without being aware of our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was embarrassed to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution -- they believed that there was only an accurate way to the <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer from Chinese opera, as my dream singer,
This was me, in my imaginary piano <unk>
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
<unk> <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not propaganda for <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but very strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt trap. and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also given to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
So for example, this map seemed to me, because this is what students are in China to learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to the fields of research as religion comparative and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if you read comparative reading work for research, why don't you do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- rather than lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back or feel like that.
Having a dream to be <unk> is not something compared to what many others have <unk>
I have come to believe that writing is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
It can do that for you.
And that's because of books today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client from <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 15-year-old woman called <unk>
And Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> wrote on the couch on my office and grabbed my shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classmates had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> made me easy to just move the head as they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, you get home later, you got kids after the death later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my mechanism said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of horrible <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take sleep a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the <unk> of truth matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
That means eight in every 10 of those decisions and experiences and moments, which gives you a way to your life when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more than 40, they don't panic at <unk>
This audience will be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know more than half of the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future couple years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality. It changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated at the <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence of <unk>
<unk> would tell them <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
He Leonard Cohen said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and his ambition is absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, smart smart, like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter. I'm just killing time."
Or say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts going like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better estimate the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going like this: "My quotes during <unk> they were like your chairs.
They were all running, but then somewhere around the 30, they turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be just standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure of pressure and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, to choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about to realize that you can't have the career you want now.
Notice that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give him a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I am, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was I <unk>
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, she came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity crisis having a crisis of identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed the most I was more proud of the ambition.
And despite living very difficult, their previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often up in our <unk> but then she was getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many contacts, but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the <unk> <unk> case of <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if he gives me <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot to resist and not say, <unk>
What she needed her was not a <unk> of truth <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> of Emma went on.
So for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who will spread out of that identity crisis, and we <unk> identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company that you want to do it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm showing you the exploration that shouldn't tell you that, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them tell.
Secondly, I said to Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent for you to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with a similar minds are limited to who you know what you know about, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is coming out of it almost always comes from the outside circle.
The new things come from what they're called intense bonds from friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the way we get to this group.
Half of the work that we created never was <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not least, Emma believed you don't choose your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> she quickly <unk> her family, when he has a partner and there was a couple of their own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better enough to sit on your mind than 20, even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now, or you're going to tell you, now when everyone on Facebook begins to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you want, and that means to be as <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing is going to work or killing time with anyone who owns you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out of Los Angeles, who come somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> light on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
Similarly, in the same way, at 21 or 25 to the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the following generation.
Here's my idea that is worthy of spreading all the seeds that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get out of identity capital, use their perceptual bonds -- pick your family weaker and choose your family.
Don't you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to show up mathematics to seventh grade in the public school in New York.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me explain.
When I work back, I will pay grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no test <unk>
Some of my smartest kids, I wasn't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in a better way.
Is it <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults all over the kind of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what we would do in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We associate with private enterprises, asking questions, what of these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these different contexts -- a feature of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the week, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools, in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more likely to protect themselves, even when they were imprisoned in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the safety that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> matters in school, especially for the kids at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science is about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we build the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid work ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly <unk> is not related to or is even related to productivity as well.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not true, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a big idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I end up my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty, shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was going through this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can take down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
We only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easier way.
An <unk> Chinese academic, 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic signs -- menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or paper.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it might be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> I am <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of calls -- but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of doors in the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they think many more characters.
One person.
If someone walk back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch out your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a tumor.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a sea tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two together, it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> got someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, keep careful is <unk>
So we've been past nearly 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build others 32.
So with every little bit of effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun sitting at the beginning, because Japan is the east of China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains, one about the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking about and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and I'll take a magic bug.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of an industrial fantasy game show.
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It doesn't start that trend.
The trend actually took the rise 40 years later with, interestingly, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a young boy <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician magician,
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
We had the magic shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing of the magician in the magician is that the most powerful characters, wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star "Star my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a kid.
About three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>   So she was suspended in the room, and she was impressed like a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I would get rid of everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would feel that Luke is one to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does the film?
They do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to <unk> OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much low-level capital force in the movies for our children, and so little about the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that the princess <unk> does not provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I was hoping that the credits were really hoping that the credits would actually come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a kid, you have to be an silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to stand up to the <unk> of Disney versus any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but boys, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time is still shown in classic after classic <unk> every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
So far as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not rooted in our roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend about the evaluation of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do, in the film, there are more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women speak each other at some point in the movie?
Their talks are about something else from the boy than you like it?  Really? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood <unk>
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular movies, how many of them do they think they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen to be recently for Congress, so it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to spread this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're getting that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistical statistic and we want to make it out.
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would be, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean most of the parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of this masculinity is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the paper that we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character was <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle only and more stories where he looked at my job is to join a team, maybe a team led to women, helping other people better and being better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was more like to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine -- because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see.
However, over time, I would give up <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love and <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that you can see my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of about 1.3 miles of length along with <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to do differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we see the infrared rate.
This is a place located in the eastern Eastern Delta.
And the place is to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using infrared -- suddenly the place looks like the bright pink place.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the former Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old city, which is called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find out to find the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes and using baseball gloves on.
So, we used NASA NASA data to make a map of the place with very subtle.
So we were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interestingly, this elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots take on the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer -- we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> we have a <unk> <unk> of years that date from the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what it shows there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used to the jewelry, most of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a bank jewelry shop.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but it <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire. It probably was written in <unk> four years ago:
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas happen really started in 1984 B.C. C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the shells of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we would take a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> race and they're going to address their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide in front of the door against your house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that pass on the top side, the rays of the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the negativity threshold.
The lobby, to the hall to the hall, or what there's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, and the light is shining about the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse for speech.
Can you feel your blue <unk> doing tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you start to get into the mouth.
They go on one side and draw out to their living room.
Already in the room, and making most of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
She's with little clothes, dancing on the middle of the center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now I get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow building and from the oven come to you -- <unk> Man from <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages, and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> just just once.
We had the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We collected whole poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their addresses, and that the medieval academics used to memorize books to <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a plastic deck live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by a <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up getting most of the year next to not just training my memory, but also how to try to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even know that I had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Someone who is incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see where our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a lot of treaties on writing memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin memory, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory -- not one thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed us.
It has changed to us, and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University College in London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will have brains in some brains of structural structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, you put their brains while they were using numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that on the memory champions you get rid of the brain, different from the brain.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive deal with a armed race in where every year appears somebody with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 percent of his day -- <unk> who's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
On half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all of the techniques used at the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you say?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told to say that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories to dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home from working.
Would you probably get some <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back and a half thousand years ago in the <unk> Greece of it.
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
History says this way: there was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before I was wanted to give a very good party, he didn't bring to a <unk> it was attached to a <unk>
He stood up to me, <unk> his memory poem -- and it was <unk> and as soon as it was -- the <unk> <unk>
Let's get everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies to be <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed eyes, and I realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you have to take place at that moment is something that we all know more or less -- and it is that no matter whether we are not good at being able to remember names, or phone numbers, or instructions for word of our colleagues, we have visual and exceptional memory and exceptional spatial memory.
If you let them tell me that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who I was sitting on the horse website, brown website, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and look at images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, the same way he would have done it, if they would have invited him to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that utterly <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk, would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like speakers <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word, that it's going to confuse you, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory courthouse.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> and I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before sitting to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is getting more and more the ability to create the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the security shows, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
And I ended up coming back back to the same competition that had covered a year earlier. I had the idea that I could actually put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be a good job for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers on the phone, but actually this isn't the point.
These are just just tricks.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build up the memory of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from a little insights about how their mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will be a kind of deep processing species, a kind of complete attention that most is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
So how much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side will be so <unk> that we don't even bother processing in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would only take a place to <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six and lived in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that sharing with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you guys were watching television on television. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got <unk> and I would come back in a towel -- all of you saw.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> not safe and <unk>
He took that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and it's not about division of areas, but from those emotional connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we get.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans pass 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by being based on a building and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that are going to work.
So we met with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing -- columns, brick red, who will leave <unk> what we're trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, was ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different.
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly raising new technologies, new technologies to live in today's life.
We <unk> we gave us so far away from the people.
Everyone of black, this will be <unk> you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go on the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols of it.
So we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we are all happy, so we start experimenting with the <unk> and we start to have the next 300 years ahead and over and over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> years ago.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Really very hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we converted them into skyscrapers -- that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were going to be won in audacious and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the slums, and in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
And perhaps with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know this very well, and all of you know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we started to experiment with so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols we have now -- we now have new design techniques to a computer, and we find it with new <unk> a little bit of ways that would be implanted against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk> happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academics and public people in general, they were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times newspaper.
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how can it be possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around and quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture.
This phenomenon is from the beginning of the new millennials with other star architects.
I went to <unk> and to <unk> and what happened with these very few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, it actually began to happen with all architecture.
Think about it, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is also transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere -- that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we know if the one I designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the people are.
That's never going to happen to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> steel or the <unk> and is the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, to be in both extremes of <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional payload -- something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building which is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that summer, when people started to get in and they shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did in the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what is a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can carry the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words like <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't take something that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum is <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
That means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> of red brick based on ideas of what should be a <unk>
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for ways that will produce.
That means that buildings will be <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for doing sports or for <unk> or even one can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream in swimming on the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides of it.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings just not only reflect our society, but they give up to the more mature spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we went to our children, and the flip step to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does it for that great typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you really like to do for the moment is look at you in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives you these big kisses big and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of their friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when I did that?
How is that all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Mark "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, there's a little confused because, despite the fact that his mom tells him all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Out of what your mom tells him and what your friends, or friends or colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 dollars.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, who receives these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, teenage girls today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking about -- giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never done.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures of the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of liking they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a live living and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what drives digitally.
What's the highlight of someone in front of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now one routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see with the young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the horror stars of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals who are <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities and their studies and other things start to be hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how to taxpayers and the field of work development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They were engaging in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention for their physical function.
One in five are not attending lectures at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at good enough if you don't think you're good enough -- you get a lowest note to the average of your companions who don't care about that of the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it gives it regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be good of course, we're talking about as you see you, not how you are.
The <unk> sense about its body is <unk> academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy than you can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make more sensible decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> creativity, sexual relationships in both early ages without protection and harm damage.
The perfect body search is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no longer rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed by when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus in six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six other aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide a education on body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take on charge of the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
To challenge the status of the way women are viewed and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell our politicians in your <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not because you see them.
We can all start doing it by taking the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In summary, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so our children will grow to the valuing their whole person, to valuing the <unk> diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are really marking the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be those who come out on the big screen, because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they have never been <unk> of being who they are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in your mind?
At their <unk>
At their <unk>
At their <unk>
His <unk>
It could just be the woman who is two seats.
What would it mean for her if we would do this, and release it to his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk>
But let's get to our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
I would encourage the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today become agents of security agents in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On top of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
It was initially that they said it was naive, but being a prisoner for other municipal charges in the company of others, started planning to plan attacks about 12 cones from New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily for those plans to be held by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being him a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American mother, elementary school master's of the two made everything possible for me to give me an happy childhood, too.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even the majority of the Muslims, get to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use every possible means that everyone lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last end of this week, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shot of <unk> who, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot him at the little bit of he shot him on the target and a surprise of all of all, especially mine, all of my goal in fire.
My uncle went into the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a father, as a father, such a child.
But all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they seemed so funny.
Did you see it in me, the same level of destruction that my father might <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a van down with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground of the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called her <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was a time to pack and go to another city.
And as I was always my new face of the class that was often a <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new class of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to say <unk> <unk> for <unk> wasn't prepared for the real world.
It was opera, opera, to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had had ever friendship, was Jewish one.
I took several days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was really proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of life had been made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush -- <unk> park.
I met with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures -- that experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life was taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
By the way, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, on a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of each other, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is the closet, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me become <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation. You have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keeps my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that kind of hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that somebody else is trying to take the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I was given to this ideology of violent and <unk> ideology I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those acts of terror, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put here as a proof that violence is not inherently inherent to any religion or race. That kids don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there is a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible film <unk>
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood times you project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a <unk> voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you, you and you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of your own.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If you were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we have to produce the results that we have to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness of consciousness.
Science by nature, it's objective of it.
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we will get that vision.
<unk> is studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> and they said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work that I did Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the brain areas that are involved with the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a rocket science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing what certain areas of the brain do and what are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't follow the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by <unk>
Why is an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how <unk> are going to adapt and adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about how we speak, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have much to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a <unk> scientific theory that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful search chain, so great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think awareness, right now is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no hard problem in consciousness.
All the idea of the whole idea of the virtual subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions in your brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and that's what everything needs to be explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the radical kind of idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Doctors sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> space, the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, it looks principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes the fundamental list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- large time, mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws would be.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass times, then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to make consciousness as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not an object in science, right?
It opens up the way to look out scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space -- time, mass processes -- <unk>
So physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we want to be able to do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them together in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor for consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone thought something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental stuff.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind looks more like a continuum with nature.
So a deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that make sense of thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is processing information, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex complex, as in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a measure of integration integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of data integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a level of integration integration of information, just as significant awareness.
But when you get to the worms. microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the theory, there is still going to be a different awareness of any zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can be eaten as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is that he puts it into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to eat anything that had to be <unk> then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that all right, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> it has a complicated information processing -- integrated information, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of development systems of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of the whole, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk -- right now, we have a TED conscience -- an inner movie for this whole TED group of TED, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how are those thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and we love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile, an underwater profile.
I went to school, I went back to my friends, and I was stuck with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to give him an award of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a problem without touching it.
She actually hasn't gotten nothing."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered an achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
Many years later, being in the second part of the teaching at a high school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the middle of 11 studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you think?
Well, I had been talking to them about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this boy had had experiences with people with disabled objects like inspiration.
And we are. And it's not the fault of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for inspiring.
And, in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to give you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid -- <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have been lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability that makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and you cannot do it instead.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before we have <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You might be seen by the little girl without drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we put a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will encourage people to benefit from people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of numbers of times that I've been talking about, <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or an source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I was excited to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images, those images are providing people with disability to benefit people without disabilities.
You're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough person.
We would make some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to do it in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say to us, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold for us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky to them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.   <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery cell battery into the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but in a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that we have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad thing: the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles on the stairs has not made it to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude turning all of those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that are <unk> to get up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 in a high school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is to know about it that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just to answer one of these questions, so please, don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something to happen in our days and happen to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step is what I carry <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> is a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
So I have to create a framework that you would call your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the game camp, to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> trying to <unk> all of her being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I put some videos to show what is using Google <unk> under the hull, giving them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is an submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment. <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You might have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more than a feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be your favorite <unk> and you have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which is probably a lot of you already already.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a coaster in Russian for her life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> by launching the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a stick in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to actually <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when they <unk> them and owners see the information from what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief story about the technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> on his field <unk> so it would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, easier.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming into your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a little bit of plastic that you take on. You don't have to worry about going to forget a <unk>
Or for keeping the strategy.
They just go out to the field and make it happen.
And the coaches want to do it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is send to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
bad people will have information <unk>
This is going to look at good teams of the bad ones.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for speculation.
It's also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would it be in the country?
Imagine that they are the <unk>
They would hold the ball and <unk>
<unk> a wide open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Typically, but the <unk> system will <unk> you.
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> you would tell you that there's a open receiver
<unk> the <unk> but you get stuck.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. However, the receptor sees its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> catching up the <unk> runs and <unk>
The real audience and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion.
I will do a lot of people check it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much of this technology is worth of gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be <unk>
How much for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the choices we take and the challenges we face is that we face ourselves as usual, from us.
Thank you.
I was recently embarrassed after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was <unk> the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to the beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an international head engineer building the bridge said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that each of it frees you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks through the bones, some of which we will make vital organs.
Most of the <unk>
The ones that don't normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the people who have this method of suicide realize is the death of the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the cord.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people were in order to get their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in your dark time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to a officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were going to sell suicide, to the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, publishing veterans are trained to new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the 22 <unk> last year by receiving a call of a suicide condition, sitting in the sidewalk near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I noticed Jason talking with an officer of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to two times before New Jersey to try to kill it from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> asked if we knew about the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She was left <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so we said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and she left.
This clever guy in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason was <unk>
Parkinson's damage damage a lot of people.
I ask these questions, what would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it being <unk>
What <unk>
What would you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like because you probably didn't get it.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have had to end up their life -- you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be able to think about it: <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you her letter.
She lost his son on January 19 in January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
It has to be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing it more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father in January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and told me that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> at the afternoon of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having a real mental illness.
It must be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible legal subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north one.
I took my bike. On the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me immediately noticed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to take that day back over that lane and give it to the other opportunity.
When Kevin went, the <unk>
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But he asked him, "What was it that he did to <unk> and gave him the hope and the other <unk> life.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You let me talk and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events from 11 <unk> and you're one of the reasons that Kevin moves with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I read Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
I firmly believe with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited San Francisco General that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I know I had it to do it.
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspired others.
suicide is not just something that I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had a poison.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people, or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own chest pain.
Typically, this is achieved by three things: to sleep, the drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And for that time, I took his hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And we <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we come to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped out of the bridge and lived -- and you can talk about it, that percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they left side the railing realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every single one of us should be working on to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but on your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, "How do you focus on that?
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt that I had ever achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I go over later when I look at this picture, I think, you got it, you got it, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the belief that around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my own even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is my own.
I had been recorded as a <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I was always wearing this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always carrying that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never taught me to share my story, not because I thought it will be bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who embrace me like am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when she was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a beautiful beauty competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I had a <unk> she was going to be used on the expense of <unk> and the door, and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and he had been third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, it was within the world of the <unk> of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was of beauty of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> especially when he <unk> the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother, who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that they passed my <unk> <unk> I could go to the United States.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and he said, "You know if you cling to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand at age 19.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was <unk> lived his truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who are <unk> and <unk>
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my truth living and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent of <unk>
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  So thank you, thank you.  So thank you.  So let me give you a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Oh, <unk> -- first, thank you all my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take the phone, he was calling my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put a gender at birth -- and what I attempt to do is to put on the table that sometimes that assignment, not block, and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I'd have to have understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, parents generally know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education in 2007. And when they went to their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we <unk> a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of the <unk> of inequality and violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when you were born, a girl, his birth <unk>
It's not welcome not for her father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood next -- gives you their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother gets a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, he was <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it was at home and school admits of his siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years, somehow has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you would keep him out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if I would give the code to that code of that honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this honor code is not only the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the best.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and women's decisions even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like whether he doesn't like it, with an old man he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young one, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter and so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old and a half years old in my school.
So you might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?"
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
One of the school would mean that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them was able to go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was born, the form of a Canadian Canada, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I would sit on to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> her personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school girls and boys in the way.
I used education for <unk>
I met my daughters, he taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we met with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned at school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> millions, but just a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, and he was offered for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform I could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between my life and death, he would tell me to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause of it.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot of <unk> for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and had pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was crushed by the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never get away.
I used to <unk> "I am well with my smile, <unk> and the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when he doesn't finish his job.
They fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy about it.
People say, "What's in special in my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut its wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google X. But all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain program.
You're still just smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and he had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, gray, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to keep them alive.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to go through to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how little changes in the dose of the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way of thinking about my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemicals for a man in 1900s, and I was surprised to see how I would see my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known several types of types of this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out like an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that he had in front of it, and just wouldn't happen that way.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, from then I have better with men.
What I was trying to achieve. I would adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of reference to the key reference to how I use these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you become <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there is those people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to the thought and <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I could find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get very quickly these mental images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could draw the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in achieving this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups that were leading in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain that same individual as you were looking at, watching that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left-hand side, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into the visual <unk>
Let's go through this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they <unk> their brains to create a great pool of the brain of the brain to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new people, new animals, new animals, and as long as they become a new <unk>
And the computer, using just the scanning brain data -- it would take you to show what it seemed like the person was looking like.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're well close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you think of the brain itself <unk>
This has been conducted with the largest brain scanning systems that are available today, and its resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give myself that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques from images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, most <unk> magnets just offer small improvements in resolution, not increases by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of more big magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
Why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> radio <unk> in MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field, they will be able to <unk> liquid patterns -- <unk> the frequencies of <unk> radio.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns, we can dramatically increase the information that you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can divide into layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into the digital media <unk>
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You know, the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool for amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and the similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the interesting closet in between.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet is probably going to be telling yourself a person for the first time your love or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who's got cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
And all interesting is a difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and come out of that closet kind of universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> and my <unk> my head <unk> I would usually ask you a little boy, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee a little bit, with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and her mother tossed a cold.
But I would say nothing and <unk> on it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" that we would do.
So I took a big breath, and I went down to my back and my backs a little girl in four years with a rose dress with a pink <unk> looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
So I took a big breath, and I started <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one boy, and I saw boy, but I'm a girl, but I'm a girl, you know, as you like to use a rose dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more than kind of a girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything. "Oh, you are a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some sides in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feels living in a closet.
Like my closet as my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard to not be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared in banking banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old son to tell you."
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to stop classify what is difficult for someone that is hard to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
Somewhere in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, he had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight every child in four years that would go to coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my gay, gay grenade -- and the move just a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole strangers with whom I've spent my whole life trying not to <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade launches was my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and in my <unk> <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents' friends -- people who were known to be years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite singing TV program.
Our singing program Will and Grace
And you know who would be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I'm hoping desperately to show her support, to get me knowing that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and see the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask to ask someone, but to <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone who has <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of every closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other people must know we also have.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will kill the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be <unk> by that.
And some of them can come out and hurt secure, <unk> by what they've done, but you never feel sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark way, interesting <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very well for yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous <unk> quote from the question that "The question of whether a machine might think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question has been <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's go back to a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or from the Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that has no concept of Earth on Earth -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that are going to solve the surface of a planet -- they stop trying to do it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took about several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately immersed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will do, the diversity of future future.
Finally, in planning for robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and putting together together, I said, for a number of years, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a and = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an F force, that acts with the order of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, to an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so, having to tell this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the surprising applications of this simple equation. equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> for their life should be able to trend more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence, the more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you meet in.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without being taught to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a <unk> human, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability for tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing extreme ends, opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has really interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game, against themselves, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly moving, and it keeps the net very connected.
This same power capacity also has applications of health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated actions, <unk> in a simulated actions, successfully increasing assets under its exponentially.
This risk management skill will have broad applications in finance, safe and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation. They all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So back to the beginning of the use of the term -- robot, the work -- there was always the concept that if you had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would have been <unk>
The machines will be linked against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion to the other way around.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's the other thing that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a very fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the goal.
They often ask, how is it that you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants of helping to go to the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial intelligence or help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence, intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the fear of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how to fit Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is where the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a spatial telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go over in front of them, and block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
Data picked up the Kepler shows the planets of planets on the distance that there are between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their own feelings.
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds with potentially <unk> worlds -- under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hotter record.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us from the millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale has <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a weather scientist and no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone who is interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that has been potentially <unk> by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and partly that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface into the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Chinese companies now offer not just short space flight but also <unk> a chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and the ideas that are linked to the Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still go through <unk> places that are really comfortable in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets will understand, and the belief and the belief that I think Mars is waiting for some of us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know it's truly habitable the Earth.
For a lot of my way that I like to look at my exploration, I'm in profound disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to <unk> humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on a place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and maintaining life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just getting closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep space spaces, in the hostile areas and <unk> on the ground, maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Enrico Fermi realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were lots of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to evolve this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but <unk> planetary preservation can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to figure out to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the way even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see from the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty cool.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because he had an early flight Europe in the next morning, and my <unk> my passport and my suitcase.
It would be expensive, but sure no more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it was very low.
I'm a neurologist, and I know a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter counter in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be able to do, systems that could put in place that would be bad things to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen to be <unk> the probability of a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month after my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him about the window, and I had forgotten about the window, and Danny shared my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and trying to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, and then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things to be going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, you get a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the same, where the fish are, where the trees are, where the tribes of female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It is the part of the brain that allows you to <unk> to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not as good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, read and <unk>
So at home you get a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport. A <unk>
For your reading glasses, a particular <unk>
If you go into a place and are <unk> with it -- you will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license <unk> five to mail themselves so they're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on it.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention, or the one of a loved thing, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this would be <unk> as a <unk> for all of a medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that needs to take that to take out of a rational decision of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I get the outcome of the lab and your cholesterol is a little <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack on the heart, stroke <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even more likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and whether it's somebody's guilt like me.
We haven't really understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to research on the researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance of 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and you have to be asked from the <unk> <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and chronic grief pain, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that low stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 to side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out by the drug that can help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say that they must have this conversation with their physician.
The medical ethic is a part of the beginning of an informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You might be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number needed to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the top men in the top men in cancer, the number you need to try is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you might argue that we will experience the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases out <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predatory is not necessary for a predatory system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could get to be heart lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense -- rational like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to avoid that bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I settled on a combination of combination with the door, with a key door to the gate -- an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages from email that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, and there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the past decade and over the time with the time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for anything.
Sound is a very important part of my life, are really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a single world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign world, to <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can make sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned for ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, sure not <unk> the covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound of more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound, about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> to decide.
We were going to go on to go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it be with my thumb and it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, to an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience visually, or experience visually, or even a idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property and to reclaim the sound of the artistic practice in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was actually struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it might be so powerful that I could be able to <unk> myself and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people that can be supportive of equal and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, in order to <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it at <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic artistic <unk> in the music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning that both of the signals like sound.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into a lot of different <unk>
If you added a different parameter for each finger while the piano, as the facial expression, the body movement, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you get just a key to a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in a way to express a concept of course or an idea of <unk>
If just a key to change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, they can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk>
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk> me.
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of the music?
If I had to create a sign and you shake it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun and you get it.
This is <unk> <unk>
If you put it up, and you push it down, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how the time is expressed in <unk> and how far the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand -- two <unk> is two hands, the present you get closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the final one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, dramatic at the same time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times a <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> hand hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and your chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of your hands up.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like her chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help to communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this: please, do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they do it meanings very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as music.
However, today, we live in a very strict world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have any social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove of drought, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I was older, I found out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning the others.
The country, now I'm an adult and teach in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we have these little plastic chunks of plastic to look at them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put together this information on a map.
But an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these enormous scales.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work of work in order for young kids to <unk> so that they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools, feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it into the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
And then we actually created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick to create prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light and chambers in accessories and they put it into a floating robot that gets slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of just captured by the robot.
We see plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor as the computer on board processing this picture and measuring the size of each <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would do it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they were trying to make it immediately.
I can investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and it will be <unk> with this image: actually.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> where the place they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown color and when it's all <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of things that produce different <unk> what can help to identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or about analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away with a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and you might remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central water.
And today, according to the reports of the average reports of 300 tons are still filtering from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast -- and the most, of the moment, it has to look safe is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I have come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't do it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different different animals.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> alternatives to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust goes off from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition near the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear used, and we are approaching the intelligence of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea of the sea with a tracking of sediment as we invented and built and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little so small therefore, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to the social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, in which you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the children of children can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help in the mobility population to transforming their standard wheelchair chairs into new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect children from the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation for us to worry about the environment and people, and so that can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other of one silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is a imposes on the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the raw, they saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But the living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that we needed for every cell to work and to do it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily as a filter, the other mostly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that gets gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here is a divided screen that represents my view of the world <unk> twice the personality of every designer and an architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the <unk> and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and synthetic hemisphere shows that two screens behind me.
My work, on its simplest level, is about bringing these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and getting to growth.
So you're probably wondering why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my students' <unk>
We design objects, products, and structures and tools through scale, large-scale meters -- like this <unk> with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a rating that gives you not very distant to print <unk> buildings, and graphics <unk> made of genetically altered <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each sector is the unique size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion theorist with <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
<unk> with 3D printing 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells. I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical analytical and <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair, a chair in both the comfortable structural and also that absorbs sound.
The Carter professor -- my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and when we design this <unk> surface of the <unk> surface becomes <unk>
It would take this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like nature varies its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's the nature of <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and really defining what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the Earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often wonder, "What would be the design if the objects were made of a <unk>
Do you have a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to <unk> the kind of material that the tree is attached to fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of tons of tons of <unk> or shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we were able to <unk> their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from the dark, hard and adapt to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of the material in the march and create these structures made out of a single three-dimensional material -- 100 percent recyclable life.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it out to find a natural shape to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to hold <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we had been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with dense <unk> and if it broadens even further.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks into an architecture that acts like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed for <unk> in the sea, <unk> life -- and placed in the floor, will help grow a tree.
The texture for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the ability to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we should master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, we got into two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water <unk>
And the second E. E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human <unk>
One turns out the light in sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel which looks like a <unk> tract that will help you to <unk> these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function <unk>
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more of them, they would get more transparent channels.
This internal system <unk> when you stretch from one end to the other, it spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are a wonderful <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the tissue hurt -- and we <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints out of layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces in life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we actually attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would put a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
You often get <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can be able to shape <unk> silk without boiling <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing <unk> <unk> and we put it in our site.
We knew that silk worms were <unk> to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, will destroy silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to <unk>
We <unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
As a <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk -- <unk> all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and went on, and she was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer challenging -- it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I sort of struck me for something else, something totally different, and I was excited about it, and I let me absorb and I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all of this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my own passions and encourage them to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or to be tracked or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have ever raised me.
To do it -- where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you have learned it from the culture.
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were talking to that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is now getting us over and over again as you grow in a different way, and you have to go back to high school students, you ask them you're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what the dream.
Why?
While this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream of what they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer to 20 different things, but adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor later in <unk> <unk> a teacher and a creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of manifest or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to spend on the time on this land, in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you split up in three parts: multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
So during the age of the Renaissance the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any of you like it or a <unk> one of your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as a limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned from talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers ...
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> -- <unk> his shared interests in our visualization visualization, visualization of data, traveling mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates migraine jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all of their background, they can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second <unk> superpower, is learning fast.
When we put them up, we are interested in it.
We observe everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> because they have been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid to test new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
As a little girl who had an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quick <unk>
Before it become a writer, I was a <unk> <unk>
He had to learn the smallest sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write a compelling line for editors editors.
<unk> is rarely a waste of time to go to what you would give to you, even if you could do it at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third <unk> superpower, is adaptability. It is to say, the ability to become anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other online pages -- sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if you're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to do in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> on the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and the <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely are given to them as simply as their partners <unk>
Once this, if there's one thing that you will take out of this talk, I hope that this is this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart attack, then, <unk> for all media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I'm like, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep up with these <unk> <unk>
Do you get the intersections.
We would have our inner wiring inside of the inner and a happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world will <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year -- a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it was unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had to be alive today, we couldn't give it more help than the one that he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been able antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little has been made by treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's disease is almost one of each of the two.
In other words, there is the probability of passing their teenage years, with Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or they wanted Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
It is the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> a rise of five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be allowed to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's disease and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but the entire world is that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain that compared to the <unk> patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to spark a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and is always being deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> about a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made from protein molecules today.
You can think a molecule of protein like a piece of paper that folds up like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the dots are left in the outside.
That makes the molecules out of protein <unk> each other, forming a big plate and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and what step out of what step is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have shrunk and waiting for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that extend specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs happened in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that <unk> each other as in humans as well as Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this sample that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to beat the disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to make sure that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we put it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure drug industry, and in scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not the majority of cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the Latin African column, in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it as one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will be <unk> to take care more and more personal and then both you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or your ability, what would it be?
Number one: When was the last time you would read somebody else's <unk>
And we <unk>
<unk> they <unk> these are increasingly <unk>
Number one: <unk> really struck me, <unk> your partner what you like from him or she -- I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've never met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we had been <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the adventurous column, looking for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you would probably be wondering: they still follow together.
And the reason I think about this is because I've done this question for me and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred view as a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand <unk>
And that came up with a relatively new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But it had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and now the Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got more than eight million views, and I was like, by saying something, I'm just ready for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call them or write what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: They're still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search at the mailbox with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was getting into radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did to make a public emergence together.
We had TV interviews, and <unk> orders for us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid of becoming the icons of <unk> from the process of <unk> a range of the <unk> which I didn't feel at all of us.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study had worked -- they wanted to know if the study was really able to know if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but love -- love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions that is less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> to <unk> <unk> among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds like, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing it. Several later studies, also used <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community, and they have been used by people in the world of political political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and he said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would tell you about the person who would take it to you.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did do better do better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
He'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took to science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and hoped that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just worked for the book that I wrote in retrospect, it seems to really <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love -- I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much more than a reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for love is a goal, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> depending on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate something of <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, I want to make them more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who she deserves your love and who doesn't?
How to stay in love with the things that are <unk> and how to know when to know when to cut back and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more conservative conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I used to apply a study that is designed to create romantic love, we have to keep us together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love -- it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper. Love did not happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading now, not because it doesn't really be true, but because at the moment, there was not considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how sometimes it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answered, 36 questions, having chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun and fun by expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I would do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian in full mountain -- and in a way, I was like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar bill a dollar, a pen and a fork in a fork in Colorado.
And I thought some of the weird <unk> or some of the aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment he was in <unk> <unk> like to go from trip to <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the Agnes style, I covered it from resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: somehow it seemed to increase the size of size, as if it was that they would play the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, strange bottles that was finding out of the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> to draw just like a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of individuals -- <unk>
First of all, you get a sense of what an idea will be done.
And then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool. man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of resin with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use it.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and he had all these windows together that form a three-dimensional composition here.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by largely in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 5,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has twice a face, so they're 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the blood source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh <unk> where you <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a great god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
From all ways also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while in the other hand, and the other hand comes out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand in which you <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of <unk> a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things I go, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> balloon <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
They've <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very good at your time.  This brings me to my latest project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or then.
But each one acts as a kind of a human archive in the form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, get together <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's got to be able to get it into the <unk>
I will play it for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and it takes the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two head, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity within it.
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a museum, a school, an undercover arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
And the box is <unk> and all of the people from inside hits each other as the particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you come in, who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will be able to be able to see in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs, these are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and you will increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects, in their most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to your blood current -- it will be <unk> and worse still for the time that it takes to get to its fate, which is where it's more important in the HIV store.
These are regions of the body like the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood blood of the patients that will be <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life by run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Wow, that will get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery in diabetes, they can be used for anything <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes, that open up and close -- almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce the medication.
The best you say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in liquid that contains drug drugs.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug would absorb a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is actually <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology, or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can <unk>
Well, the answer is: through a three device from three heads.
With the first head, that's our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to place the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of everything else in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation in a non-violent <unk>
I do work in the field of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, the <unk> peacekeeping arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why you can do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they didn't get it.
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
Today's armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set up a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
<unk> a complex machine, of communication stations radio stations on TV websites and web websites and strategies in social media.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Men are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising and using business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Men are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run in schools, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Men are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan destroyed by the war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also look at the efforts of these groups for creating safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price of high price for the population.
But in general, provide social services means filling up a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase power.
For example, the election election in 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps to the government, and come together as armed groups and politicians, participate in the violent struggle and make governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated organizations, it's all these organizations, less we can <unk> it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They get part of a territory, running out of all of its function, collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak ones are the states, like the Middle East and the <unk> in the Middle East, and they fill that gap to non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools not military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better than our groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to encourage the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> military power can win some odds, but we won't give us economic and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that security gap to fill that <unk> of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but afraid.
I am a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was given to me as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an item, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> the sex.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that would be a feminist.
It will be labeled <unk> a <unk> a very taboo word, a nasty word.
I love myself as a woman who follows the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman who would be <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I get the same pay.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use <unk> and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have the other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexual condition, and much more.
We have to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear music rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades into women and offends the <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
Do you love your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical evidence.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but they also kill insects, and the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink color is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic <unk> from the tales of <unk> <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I don't have that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is rooted in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they were born.
<unk> this problem.
<unk> Feminism conventional that has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, and gay workers, and <unk> for women, white and <unk> and high school.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist ...
It also happens to happen. As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of good <unk> from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider this <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> because of fear of what it means is that they might be able to be able to fulfill the minimal expectations
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist feminist ...
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show. Look at this star of pop-up <unk> the feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time, the cultural critics started <unk> if it was a <unk> or not quite a feminist.
It would take your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
And it's still perfection from the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more inclusive.
But what's next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the <unk> and being a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists who would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they take advantage of change affecting the profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have the music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make it make it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that all of us deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
They're two girls and <unk> <unk> and brilliant girls and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
Where are they being absorbed by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them -- all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women like sport, sport, <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio analysis when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema elsewhere when movies do not treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as <unk>
In any case, men, especially gay men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, to participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't run a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of the people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also help us to be including even more like us to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision plans.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and music, to <unk> <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting lasting change.
We can also claim with courage to do good, bad ones, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist feminist is not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, mostly because I was going to get my voice to me, and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as though it was nothing.
I started to believe that there was nothing.
It was my voice, and after everything I would not bother to believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would get stuck in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin there.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I will argue that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when more you need such <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had <unk> because we visited <unk> or for being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument on autism and the vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked from being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Group.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that, but millions of parents around the world still keep <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it believed to develop every single career without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were stable just three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funding of funds like <unk> <unk> refer to the routinely autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control Disease Control what's happening, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis -- and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his two year-old son and visual contact.
So if the diagnostic criteria had to be asked by what they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were those cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and focus on science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors talked about a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 patients who looked like 11 patients who looked like <unk> private worlds <unk> to the people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking your hands on their faces, but they were prey of the panic for <unk> like when you didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
So in the 1950s, as the main United Nations authority of the world in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as it was <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to kids with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned out that he had converted to nine of 10 kids sent out for their office to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child or a form of child or <unk> and <unk> parents.
These kids, he said, has been carefully held in a fridge that doesn't get <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they gather in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were trying to win their approval by winning their approval of the approval of winning their approval of the <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, in London, thought that the theory of mothers who were <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and warm and they had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as to keep with no support, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
So in other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did anyone didn't realize these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was German, and he would take it to her for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as <unk> <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of dealing with kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> called their little teachers, and he took to help the development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of personal and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, and seeing aspects of this continuum in biblical culture like the <unk> social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the diagnostic criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by putting into the limited model of <unk> for a wider <unk>
These changes were not on a broken <unk>
<unk> when I was going, and Judith worked between two <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards from the <unk> <unk> psychologists and fathers around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced to first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for their son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> effect of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it went, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, <unk> history of credible history like <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the status of prevention than one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right -- the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined together on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for new advances for medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of operating operating systems.
The fact that a PC works with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to cope with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
